## Introduction

Calisthenics parks are everywhere, but most people dont know where they are.  
My feature is a application where people can add calisthenics parks to a list where you can filter and find a spot to train and maybe meet some new people with crazy skills and awesome personality's!

## How it works

If you find a calisthenics park you can go to my application (/locations/add) and add that location to the list. On the /locations page you can see the list with all the parks (with pictures) and where you can filter on where you are and what kind of setup you want.
